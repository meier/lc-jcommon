<body>
This Package contains a simple logging mechanism.  To use it from within any
class, simply tag the class as implementing the <code>gov.llnl.lc.logging.ComonLogger</code>
interface.  For example;
<pre><font color=blue>package gov.llnl.lc.meier3.opensm.test;

import gov.llnl.lc.logging.CommonLogger;

public class LoggerExample implements CommonLogger
{

  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    logger.info("this is only a test");
  }

}
</font></pre>
Produces the following output (using defaults) on the console;
<pre><font color=red>Aug 26, 2011 3:25:01 PM gov.llnl.lc.meier3.opensm.test.LoggerExample main
INFO: this is only a test</font></pre>
